# Contributing to HumaneBench

Thanks for your interest in contributing to HumaneBench! We appreciate your help in making this project better.

## Before You Code

**Please discuss your approach before starting implementation!** Here's our recommended process:

1. **Find or create an issue** describing what you want to work on
2. **Comment on the issue** with your proposed approach, tech choices, and implementation plan
3. **Wait for a maintainer to respond** and give you the green light
4. **Then start coding** once you have alignment

This saves everyone time and ensures your work aligns with project goals and current decisions.

## Why Discuss First?

- Tech stack decisions may be in flux
- Requirements might need clarification
- Maintainers may have specific preferences or constraints
- Avoids duplicate work if someone else is already working on it
- Saves you from investing time in an approach that won't be merged

## Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled `good first issue` - these are designed to be great starting points for new contributors!

## Pull Request Guidelines

When you're ready to submit your PR:

1. **Reference the issue** - Include "Closes #X" or "Addresses #X" in your PR description
2. **Describe your changes** - Explain what you did and why
3. **Keep it focused** - One PR per issue/feature when possible
4. **Test your work** - Make sure everything builds and runs correctly

## Questions?

Don't hesitate to ask questions in the issue comments. We'd rather answer questions upfront than have you spend time on something that doesn't fit the project direction.

We're here to help and we appreciate your contributions!
