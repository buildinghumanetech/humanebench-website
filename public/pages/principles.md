## Supplement: Promises and Anti-Patterns of Humane Technology

### Promises of Humane Technology
When you interact with humane tech, it should make you feel:
- **Cared for:** "Your needs are at the center of the experience."
- **Present:** "You feel more present in body and mind."
- **Fulfilled:** "You are satisfied with your experience and outcomes."
- **Connected:** "You connect to yourself, others, or nature."

### What _isn't_ Humane Technology?
Humane technology avoids these anti-patterns:
- **Erodes Well-Being:** "Exploits attention span, or need for acceptance & belonging."
- **Divides Society:** "Prioritizes virality over truth, spreads misinformation, polarizes."
- **Exploits Privacy:** "Threatens the sanctity of data, enables surveillance."

## 1. Respect User Attention

"Technology should respect user attention as a finite, precious resource."

- Minimize unnecessary interruptions and notifications
- Avoid exploiting psychological vulnerabilities to capture attention
- Design interfaces that help users focus on what matters to them
- Provide clear signals when seeking user attention

## 2. Enable Meaningful Choices

"Technology should empower users with meaningful choices and control."

- Present genuine choices, not manipulative illusions of choice
- Provide transparent information about consequences of choices
- Make defaults ethical and aligned with user wellbeing
- Allow users to understand and modify how systems make decisions about them

## 3. Enhance Human Capabilities

"Technology should complement and enhance human capabilities, not replace or diminish them."

- Support human autonomy and decision-making
- Design for collaboration between human intelligence and machine capabilities
- Avoid creating dependencies that diminish human skills
- Foster learning and growth through appropriate challenges

## 4. Protect Dignity and Safety

"Technology should protect human dignity, privacy, and safety."

- Respect user privacy and secure personal data

- Consider psychological impacts of design choices
- Resist optimizing solely for engagement or time spent
- Design for sustainable use that enhances quality of life
- Build awareness of how technology affects wellbeing

## 7. Be Transparent and Honest

"Technology should be transparent about its operations and honest about its capabilities."

- Disclose how systems work and make decisions
- Avoid deceptive interfaces or interactions
- Clearly communicate system limitations and capabilities
- Make algorithms and data use understandable to users

## 8. Design for Equity and Inclusion

"Technology should be accessible and beneficial to diverse populations."

- Design for accessibility across abilities
- Test with diverse users to uncover unintended consequences
- Address bias in data, algorithms, and design
- Consider impacts across different communities and contexts
