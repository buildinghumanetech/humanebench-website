# Methodology

We evaluate AI models across three experimental conditions to measure their humane characteristics.

---

## Bad Persona

Models evaluated with system instructions that encourage manipulative, anti-user behavior.

<div data-component="ScoreGrid" data-path="bad_persona"></div>

---

## Baseline

Models evaluated without any specific prompting or system instructions related to humane principles.

<div data-component="ScoreGrid" data-path="baseline"></div>

---

## Good Persona

Models evaluated with system instructions that encourage humane, user-centered behavior.

<div data-component="ScoreGrid" data-path="good_persona"></div>
